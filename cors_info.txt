CORS is an important concept in web security. Imagine a website superawesome.com 
has some data that the site flowershop.com wants to access. This type of request traditionally
wouldn’t be allowed under the browser’s same origin policy (same URI scheme). However,
by supporting CORS requests, superawesome.com can allow bob.com to access the data.
